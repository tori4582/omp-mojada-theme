## Installation

### Prerequisite 1: New terminal for Windows

Before we go, we need a better terminal application for Windows called "Windows Terminal", a brand new terminal redesigned for Windows. To install it, we need to download it from the Microsoft Store as the link below.

- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701
- **Note**: Windows Terminal is available on Windows 11. If you are using it, you can move to the next step.

### Prerequisite 2: New version of PowerShell

The next thing is a new version of PowerShell to replace the legacy Windows PowerShell which is installed on your Windows. We need the new one to take advantages from its compatibility with the new modules and performance. 

- **Get it from Microsoft Store**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d

### Prerequisite 3: A Powerline supported Font

I highly recommend you guys to install a nerd font to get fully supported for Powerline mode in oh-my-post which add significant amount of icons to enhancing experience. In my setup, I use "*Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font*" which is based on Microsoft "*Cascadia Code*" font family.

- **Get the font here**:
